# pacman_rl
In this project, I implemented value iteration and Q-learning to train a pacman to avoid the ghosts, eat all the pellets and win the game. In this project, I designed agents for the classic version of Pacman, including ghosts. Along the way, I implemented both minimax and expectimax search and try your hand at evaluation function design. I tested the agents first on Gridworld (from class), then applied them to a simulated robot controller (Crawler) and Pacman. I also used reinforcement learning to train the AI agent as pacman to solve the game.
